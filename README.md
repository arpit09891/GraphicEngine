# GraphicEngine
August 2017 – January 2018 • C++ 
• Modified the C++ graphics Engine provided by John Paul Ownby and integrate it with assets pipeline which 
  can import meshes from Maya.  
• Supports both OpenGL and D3D platforms in 32- bit and 64-bit operating systems.
• Includes usage of smart pointers and handles.
• Basic understanding of graphics and renderer.

Note: I need to modify with this my current knowledge. Its been a year since I last modified it.
